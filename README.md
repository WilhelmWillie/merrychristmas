Christmas Coding Challenge: A self-made challenge where I code for 9 hours straight

Goal: To create a card-generation application that users can customize using user-provided photos and messages.

## Time Constraints:

* **12:00 - 1:30** Research + Planning Stage
* **1:30 - 9:30** Code Marathon
* **9:30 - 11:00** Release + Cleanup

## Log:
* **1:22 PM** About to begin a 9 hour journey of coding. I'm going to be using Django and MySQL in the backend. The biggest challenge for me will be the fact that I don't know Django very well. My end product will probably be messy and unsafe but this will be a good learning experience.
